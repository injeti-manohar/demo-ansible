# demo-ansible

This demo is based on (a now older version) of Ansible LightBulb available [here](https://github.com/ansible/lightbulb)

*Note: it is not intended to be a replacement or substitute for Ansible Lightbulb project.  The intent is to provide an easy walk thru for a smaller audience, particularly people just learning Ansible.*

* ansible-basic.sh = step-by-step demo of ansible core
* ansible-advanced.sh = step-by-step demo of ansible core advanced features
* ansible-nonroot.sh = example of running ansible w/o root

See DemoWalkThru for details on each of the above
